- Add a react select to select different charts for dynamic components
- Color schemes
- Display some text information about current iterations etc(think about it later)
- Add sound?


All features
-------------
* Users can change array size only while simulation is not running
* Users can click randomize button only while simulation is not running
* Users can change pause or play the simulation whenever they want. Button text changes from play to pause and vice-versa
* Once simulation ends, Play button changes to redo and state should be reset.
* Users can select which sorting algorithm they want to use. They cannot change this while simulation is running.
    - Once simulation is paused(before completing), if they change the sorting algorithm, the state need not be reset.
* Once simulation is completed, entire array should be sweeped.
* Display the currentIteration number on the page
* Users can select which visualizer they want(horizontal, vertical, donut etc). They cannot change this while simulation is running(think about this)
    - Once simulation is paused(before completing), if they change the visualizer, the state need not be reset.
* Have a play all at the same time sort button like in: https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms
* Add sound
* Add sample arrays that users can select from dropdown like sorted, reverse sorted, 20% sorted, 80% sorted etc;

Phase 1:
--------
* Users can change array size only while simulation is not running
* Users can click randomize button only while simulation is not running
* Add colors for comparisons and swaps.
* Look into requestAnimFrame;
* Users can change pause or play the simulation whenever they want. Button text changes from play to pause and vice-versa
* Once simulation ends, Play button changes to redo and state should be reset.
* Users can select which sorting algorithm they want to use. They cannot change this while simulation is running.
    - Once simulation is paused(before completing), if they change the sorting algorithm, the state need not be reset.
* Once simulation is completed, entire array should be sweeped.

Phase 2:
--------
* Display the currentIteration number on the page
* Users can select which visualizer they want(horizontal, vertical, donut etc). They cannot change this while simulation is running(think about this)
    - Once simulation is paused(before completing), if they change the visualizer, the state need not be reset.
* Add sound
* Have a play all at the same time sort button like in: https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms
* Add Progress bar
* Add some information about sorting algorithms and their time/space complexities
